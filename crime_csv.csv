Maxi-taxi driver charged for not assisting WPC,2024,7,19,11,0,"A maxi-taxi driver has been charged with failing to assist a police officer without reasonable excuse. The driver appeared before a Master of the Court in Port of Spain yesterday morning, and the case was adjourned to August 9. The driver's name has been withheld due to conflicting information regarding his identity. He was granted bail, which was secured by his wife. The charges were brought by WPC Jacob. According to a police report, around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, WPC Jacob was patrolling near City Gate in Port of Spain. She and other officers approached Bay Four (the La Horquetta and Maloney bay), where they noticed a man acting suspiciously with a black pouch. The police attempted to search the man, who resisted and was taken to the platform. During the search, he allegedly twisted WPC Jacob's left hand. WPC Jacob then asked for help from the driver, who was nearby. He refused, raising his hands and walking away despite her repeated requests. The suspect continued to struggle with WPC Jacob until other officers, led by Sgt Virgil, arrived to assist in detaining him. The next day, WPC Jacob and a team of officers returned to City Gate and arrested the driver. The arrest was captured by persons at the Bay and uploaded to social media sites. It has led to a public outcry over the actions of the police. He reportedly told his workers that he did not want to be seen aiding the police in such a public manner due to the seriousness of crime in this country, and he did not want to be a target of any retaliatory attacks. It was said that the police were not always present at City Gate, nor were they able to be everywhere - as it was pointed out that there had been at least 15 homicides reported this past weekend. This, persons have argued over the last few days, ought to constitute as reasonable cause, and it was argued that the charge should not have been levied against anyone in a similar situation.. However, the charge was facilitated by a law which exists within this country - Section 60 of the Police Service Act Chapter 15:01. The section notes : ""If a person is called upon to assist a police officer who is, while in the execution of his duty, assaulted or resisted or in danger of being assaulted or resisted, and such person refuses or neglects to assist accordingly without reasonable cause, he is liable on summary conviction to a fine of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and to imprisonment for one year."" However, when read in tandem with the Miscellaneous Provisions (Law Enforcement Act 25 of 2019), the penalties for this Act have increased to $10,000 and three-years of imprisonment."

In an update the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) said officers executed an intelligence-led operation on Tuesday, resulting in the seizure of over $4.5 million worth of cocaine and the arrest of a key suspect. ""The operation stems from credible intelligence developed by the TTPS in 2023, which uncovered the operations of a sophisticated drug trafficking network based in South Trinidad. This network allegedly imported illegal narcotics from South America, concealed them within legitimate cargo, and exported them to various international destinations using local courier services. Following multiple arrests and significant seizures over the past year, the TTPS intelligence unit recently received information about an impending narcotics shipment. ""Acting on this intelligence, officers identified a vehicle linked to the drug trafficking network. On Tuesday, July 9, 2024, during a surveillance operation, the vehicle was spotted travelling along roads in the North Eastern Division. With operational support from the Northern Division Police, the officers intercepted the vehicle as it travelled eastward along the Churchill Roosevelt Highway near the Grand Bazaar shopping centre.

The TTPS said officers seized a total of 3.25 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $4,530,240. The TTPS said the driver, a man from Point Fortin, was arrested and taken to the San Raphael Police Station for further inquiries. Commissioner of Police, Erla Harewood-Christopher, said intelligence gathering is critical in disrupting criminal activities. “Intelligence gathering is the cornerstone of effective policing.

Trinidad cops to be stationed in Tobago to tackle rising murder toll,2024,7,9,13,17,"Trinidad-based officers will be stationed in Tobago on a short-term basis to help tackle the island’s rising murder rate, following a recentquadruplemurder that occurred earlier this week. Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday in Tobago following a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said the support is needed as ""familiarity breeds contempt"". “Tobago’s policing…is such that we have to probably do things a little bit differently. I was advised that approximately 90 per cent of the officers who are policing Tobago are Tobagonians in Tobago, and that might be a good things…but there are certain outflows from that which cause me and others to believe that the policing effort is not as sharp as it should be, largely because of the general maxim that familiarity breeds contempt, and we have decided in a meeting this morning that the Tobago policing effort can benefit form a greater effort of intermingling of the services. “…our Tobago officers, particularly the young ones, should benefit from exposure and training with officers who are not domiciled in Tobago that will improve their development, their skill levels, that will allow them to function more effectively.” Dr Rowley said the new arrangement will include a short-term rotation of Trinidad officers and that assistance will be given to secure short-term accomodation to help facilitate this. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley held a meeting of the National Security Council in Tobago on July 9, 2024, hours after quadruple and triple murders were recorded in Black Rock, Tobago. Also attending the meeting were National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds, THA Chief Secretary Farley Augustine, Police Commissioner Erla Christopher-Harewood, THA Minority Councillor Petal Daniel-Benoit, and other senior TTPS officers. Police Commissioner Erla Harewood-Christopher said further details would be released shortly after discussions with other senior officers. Dr Rowley urged Tobagonians to cooperate with the new arrangement. “It’s not that Trinidad has perfected its own policing…we believe that Tobago, with its peculiar smaller population…should really not be overrun by criminal conduct."" He also said some Tobagonians are aware of criminal activity and must share what they know with the police. “There are a few tens of thousands of people in Tobago, many of you know exactly who is doing what and you have not been sharing that information sufficiently with the police.” When asked regarding the island's gang activity and whether the suspects belonged to Trinidad or Tobago-based gangs, the TTPS said that there are criminal elements from both islands. Dr Rowley added that Tobago's E999 system will be updated so that callers can be directed to the TTPS' Tobago offices to enhance response times, as well as creating stronger connections with Tobago communities to enhance the crime response. Additionally, he said plans are being made to strengthen Tobago's police headquarters and proposals were made for a pre-fab structure in Bacolet to establish an administrative policing centre there. Chief Secretary of the Tobago House of the Assembly, Farley Augustine, who also attended the meeting, said as an island seeking to grow its tourism revenue, Tobago must address this issue. ""I want you to see today's meeting as being proactive...we're not waiting until the situation worsens to then respond. Certainly with...one of its main productive sectors outside of the government sector in tourism, we certainly don't want this getting beyond where it is now."" On Tuesday, armed gunmen opened fire on four men who were playing cards in Black Rock, resulting in the island'sfirst quadruple murderin history, pushing the island's murder toll to 16, matching its highest record from 2009. Just hours earlier on Monday, atriple murdertook place at Black Rock, Tobago."

Gangs moving on Tobago? Police warn of 'sleeper cells',2024,7,9,10,48,"Just hours after a Joint Select Committee on National Security on Monday, on Tuesday morning, Tobago was rocked by itsfirst quadruple killing – the murders took place just hours after a triple murder took place in Black Rock, Tobago on Monday. Speaking at aJSC on National Securityto address the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) Violent Crime Reduction Plan, Legal Officer at the TTPS Special Investigations Unit, Zaheer Ali said it appears that gangs have been trying to seize territory in Tobago, contributing to recent bloodshed. “There are a few major criminal gangs that have sleeper cells in various parts of Trinidad and Tobago. It’s significant in terms of what we’re seeing in Tobago, where gangs that have established themselves…are continuing to seek other opportunities, whether it be in the context of opportunities for lucrative drug blocks or easy avenues for trafficking, dangerous drugs [etc]…that migration to Tobago is looking to take charge of territories that might be lucrative to the gangs.” Ali said the TTPS is committed to utilising anti-gang legislation to the full extent in order to crack down on these gang-related activities and to ensure convictions. “I want to assure…that we are exploring all legislation to ensure that we have control over gang and gang-related activities…” Police Commissioner Harewood-Christopher said a meeting was planned with Tobago officials to address the island’s spiralling murder rate. “I want to assure the Tobago public that our focus is on Tobago as much as it is on Trinidad. Over the last two months I would have deployed additional manpower to Tobago because we would have seen the rise of the crime. So we have officers from the GEB and the IATF now functioning in Tobago and that is a permanent initiative. “As of this morning, another team of officers from the Inter-Agency Task Force has left to provide training for frontline officers in Tobago…to ensure that they are capable and competent in doing basic road checks, teaching them to build their confidence to confront “perceived” offenders. “So we have been focusing on Tobago and we will continue to focus…as a matter of fact we will be meeting with the administration in Tobago.” Harewood-Christopher said a 15 per cent reduction in murders had been set as the target for 2024, however the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service achieved one per cent of its target, with 299 murders as of July 8 compared to 301 for the same period in 2023. In terms of targets, from January to July 8, 2024, Christopher said the TTPS achieved its target of a 15 per cent reduction in violent crime, with 2,726 reports in 2023 compared to 2,324 reports in 2024. In terms of serious crimes, the TTPS said it surpassed its 15 per cent target, with a 17 per cent reduction of 5,803 reports in 2024 compared to 7,026 reports in 2023. However, the TTPS did not meet its target of a 20 per cent detection rate, achieving a 10 per cent detection rate for 2024 to date. Regarding the implementation of the violent Crime Reduction Plan, she said the schedule had been hampered by human resource changes but would be completed by August. “We were a bit challenged with the implementation schedule and what happened over the last year we had changes with human resources…that would have set us back a bit…we are in the process of redesigning the schedule.” Harewood-Christopher said the new schedule would be completed by August 2024. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley convened a meeting of the National Security Council in Tobago on Tuesday which was also attended by Chief Secretary of the Tobago House of the Assembly Farley Augustine, to address rising crime on the island."

Tobago records first quadruple murder,2024,7,9,8,49,"With the death of Jumoke Duncan, Tobago has officially recorded its first quadruple murder. Duncan was fatally shot on Monday morning in an incident which claimed the lives of Anslem Douglas 56, of Black Rock; Samuel McKain, 56, of Mt Pleasant; and Gregory Hamlet, 53, of Golden Lane. Police were told that around 12:30am on Monday a group of men were playing cards along the main road in Black Rock when they were confronted by two armed men. The suspects opened fire on the group without warning. They then fled the scene. Douglas, Hamlet, and McKain died at the scene. Duncan died later in the day while receiving treatment at the Scarborough General Hospital. Several spent shells were found at the scene of the shooting. This incident pushes the murder toll up to 16 - which is the same number as the highest number of murders ever recorded on the island. That record was set in 2009.

Officers of the Tobago Division, under the supervision of ACP Collis Hazel and Snr Sup Rodhill Kirk, are amping up patrols and operations on the island in a bid to curb the violence. Police have been given intelligence that the latest killings are retaliatory - in response to recent shootings on the island. As such, they have classed the killings as gang-related. Snr Sup Kirk told reporter that the organisation had also received intelligence which has led to several persons being questioned. However, police are once again imploring citizens to work with law enforcement and citizens are being urged, if they see something or know something, to reach out to the police. Hazel also noted that 'all was not lost'. ""I assure you all is not lost. We are still policing the island. The police were out and about when the incident happened. It was just unfortunate these persons found themselves in such an unwanted situation,"" Hazel said. The senior officer also encouraged Tobago's residents to band together against criminal activities. He noted that the island is now facing an influx of high-powered guns, which were used in Monday's unfortunate incident. Officers of the Inter Agency Task Force and the Guard and Emergency Branch were deployed in late May to help with crime fighting initiatives and have seen successes, with the arrests of criminal elements, the dismantling of one gang and the seizure of firearms. But, the officers said that due to the porous borders of the island, high-powered weapons were finding their way into the hands of criminal elements. And as such, it is important that citizens work with the police."

"PM Rowley: 70,000 rounds of ammo bought by SSA, unaccounted for",2024,7,3,15,15,"Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said based on the results ofan auditinto the operations of the Strategic Services Agency (SSA), it was discovered that the agency had initiated the procurement of military weapons before the matter was officially approved by Cabinet, with around 70,000 rounds of ammunition still unaccounted for. Speaking on the matter in Parliament on Wednesday, Dr Rowley said the matter is being investigated by the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS). Dr Rowley said the audit discovered that a former SSA director “initiated the procurement of high-grade, military, bolt-action rifles, complete with the most modern silencers and other accessories. The SSA was engaged in training specially selected, questionably hired personnel in the skill and use of such weapons”. “All this, Madam Speaker, before the amendment to the Act in November 2023, which allowed the SSA to have and keep firearms. “It was only on November 1, 2023, upon the request from the then-director of the SSA for the agency to bear arms in certain restricted circumstances…that Cabinet approved and Parliament authorised SSA staffers to keep and carry concealed pistols whether on duty or not. “This matter is gaining the attention of the police as we speak.” “One aspect of the audit has so far revealed that the use and/or whereabouts of 70,000 rounds of ammunition purchased by the SSA remains unrecorded and unaccounted for.” He said this remains the subject of a continuing audit and police investigation while corrective action in the respect of the management of arms and ammunition has been taken. He said some of the actions taken include a review of the Firearms and Ammunition policy published in April 2022 as well as the procurement and use of vehicles, firearms and ammunition inventory checks at all SSA locations. He said prior to the authorisation in 2023, the National Security Council was not aware that the SSA possessed such a large quantity of arms and ammunition. “There was never a budget in the SSA to purchase military grade weapons nor was the NSC ever informed of any such activities or that such capabilities were being developed. “This did not prevent the SSA from making part-payment for military-grade weapons with suppression capabilities.” He said the audit also found evidence of a connection to a Christian military cult. ""Several family members and associates of particular persons and of a particular church were found to have been surreptitiously employed in the agency. Such persons belonged to a cult which was arming itself while preaching a doctrine for trained military and paramilitary personnel with a religious calling to be the most suitable persons to replace the country's leadership."" He said also referred to a 'self-described spy' who appeared at the Cumuto camp and turned over a number of weapons that had initially come from the TTPS but had been transferred to the SSA. He said several police investigations into the matter are ongoing."

They thrive on the power that we give them. The simple action of sharing their misgivings on social media gives them a voice and in so doing, exposure, that they use to recruit and poison our youth,"" Marshall said.

Charges laid against three in SSA investigation ,2024,5,21,13,1,"Charges were laid last night against three former members of the Strategic Services Agency (SSA). Pastor Ian Brown, a self-proclaimed spy for the SSA, was charged along with Sgt Sherwin Waldron and Susan Portell-Griffith. Griffith was said to be a former security supervisor, while Waldron was a tactical operations officer. They are all expected to appear before a Master of the Court on charges related to misbehaviour in public office. Major Roger Best, who formally headed the SSA, has not been charged. However, police noted that investigators were still ongoing in the matter, and they were expected to seek legal advice as it pertained to what other charges could be laid in the future. Investigators sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC yesterday afternoon on what charges if any could be laid against the three men. After some time, Gaspard gave instructions to charge the trio. Best was fired on Saturday, three days after he and the three others were detained and questioned in relation to state-issued firearms. He was released that same day. On Sunday, Prime Minister Dr Keity Rowley said that the government was “blindsided” by the allegations made concerning the SSA. At the time he was speaking during a media conference at the Piarco International Airport upon his return from India. Best was sent on administrative leave on March 2, and according to the Office of the Prime Minister, several investigations had begun within the agency following reports of “misconduct.” “We had been blindsided by this agency, but fortunately the government was able to be informed at an early stage and we approached it with vigour and commitment. There is an ongoing, very serious investigation that is taking place and as I said before, some of what has been unearthed in this investigation has been quite troublesome,” he said. According to the Prime Minister, there are also “impressions of criminal conduct” that are being investigated by the authorities. “The Cabinet did not fall short to act and we expect that we will rectify it and return the agency to its purpose,” Rowley said. He later explained that retired Brigadier General Anthony Phillips-Spencer will continue to head the SSA in the interm. ""For the time being that will be satisfactory as we try to get to the bottom of what was going on in the SSA...I can tell you a lot of what we have discovered is quite troubling, but it being a matter of national security we handled it responsibly and action has been taken and will be taken along the way. Eventually, there may be changes in the leadership but Brigadier Spencer is as good an officer we could have had to deal with these circumstances,” the Prime Minister said."

Hinds: No TTPS negotiation with gangs,2024,4,16,17,46,"National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds has denied that the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service was directed to negotiate any peace deals between rival gangs. Responding to a question in the Senate on Tuesday, Hinds made it clear that the Government neither approved nor endorsed the alleged peace deals. He said: “The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has never engaged in any such dialogue. It follows therefore that the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has never informed the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that any such dialogue was undertaken by the TTPS. It would also follow that the Government could not endorse any such action. In addition, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has never suggested to the TTPS that this should be a considered approach as Government policy.” Hinds said the Police Service is tasked with developing strategies to respond to crime and other crime management issues within the country. To this end, he said strategic plans developed by the TTPS have sought to address these issues. He pointed to the 2023 Violent Crime Reduction Plan, designed to direct response to rising levels of illegal firearms, and troubling levels of gang activity. Particularly in the instance of treating with gangs, the Minister said the plan is aimed at dismantling criminal gangs, enhancing intelligence capabilities, increasing detection, and successfully prosecuting violent and prolific offenders. “The TTPS’ plan to dismantle criminal gangs, which is consistent with the government's policy, includes conducting extensive data mining on gangs in accordance with the law, selecting the most violent gang members from the gang database in each police division, and intensively targeting them.” “Applying precision-driven law enforcement and prevention strategies to those communities with persistent violent hotspots and controlling movements on our roadways and public spaces. Those are some the main features in the anti-gang thrust that this question quite properly focuses on,” Hinds added. But, the Minister’s extensive response did little to satisfy Opposition Senator Wade Mark, who posed the initial query. In a follow-up question, Mark asked why there was no statement from the Government distancing itself from the alleged peace deal mediation involving law enforcement. Hinds stressed that there was no need for such a position as Government’s policy on treating with criminal gangs is well established. “The Government’s policy is very clear, very highly publicised. The government didn’t have to extricate itself from any such action. The Police Service, led by the Commissioner of Police made it quite clear, satisfactory enough to the Government, on behalf of the people, made it clear that it did not endorse or support any such policy or action,” the Minister said. Questioned further by Mark on the existence of rogue elements within law enforcement, Hinds said this was “well-known”, “in the generality”. “There were rogue Cabinet members in this country, some of whom found themselves before the court, that is quite known to all of us, in the generality. On this specific matter, however, the Police Service’s policy, the Government’s policy, are well-known and published. And, if in the generality any member of the Police Service or any person goes contrary to those dictates; the guidance of those policies, then of course, if it amounts to criminal action, criminal action will be, has been in those circumstances taken.” Hinds said there was nothing more he could add on the specific issue."

Who are the 'power few'? Police mount offensive against gang violence,2024,3,21,18,6,"The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) said it's continuing its strategic approach to violent crime and has been looking at several persons of interest connected with these violent crimes, termed the ""power few"". Speaking at a media briefing on Thursday at the TTPS headquarters in Port of Spain, Vena Butler, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Ag.), Criminal Division, said the police service has a defined Violence Reduction Plan. ""Team TTPS acknowledges that gangs and their activities are one of the policing challenges that we are currently facing and in that regard, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Violence Reduction Plan is our roadmap. ""We understand the challenge with violent crimes to be built around gang, firearms and narcotics and our plan was established around five pillars....precision, intelligence, prevention, pro-activity and prosecutions."" A post shared by Loop TT (@loopnewstt) Butler said in terms of precision, the police service is focusing on the ""power few"". ""Focusing on what we term the ""power few"", those we have deemed to be the prolific offenders. This is ongoing on a daily basis...this helps us to target those persons that are responsible society for the violence and that fear of crime...we are firm in our resolve that the aim is to dismantle criminal gangs. ""We know that it's a major task bt we are committed to the work. While we recognise that dismantling is our ultimate goal, in the short term, we are working towards continually disrupting the activities that lead to this violence in our communities."" Police Comissioner Erla Christopher said for the year to date, the police service has already seized 117 weapons for the year 2024 as well as 1,430 rounds of ammunition. Over the past four years the TTPS seized 2,848 firearms and 84,373 rounds of assorted ammunition. Christopher said the war on illegal firearms and on violent crime continues. The update comes after aquintuple killing in Harpe Place, leading to a murder toll to date of 124 for the year, an increase compared to the same period in 2023 in which 107 murders were recorded. Rishi Singh, Senior Superintendent, Homicide Bureau of Investigations, said 23 people were charged for 26 murders - 11 of those were charged for murders committed this year. Of the murders committed this year, over half were gang and drug-related. He said the revised detection rate for 2023 increased to 16 per cent and he anticipates more improvements as 2024 progresses. Singh said an all-of-society approach is imperative in order to prevent vulnerable groups from falling prey to gang violence and crime. ""We have to understand...civic living is a responsibility of every citizen...despite the challenges that we face we're asking you to find the courage to come forward and support..."" ""Put into perspective that within the communities where gangs are prolific...within two kilometres you have multiple persons with motives and allegiance that occupy this small geographic space...in those spaces certain types of behaviour are nurtured. ""I'm saying all of this to put into perspective that the technology, the science and the people...are all in this space, and I want to encourage that we take steps internally, in those communities, that the leaders of those communities resolve that we can no longer encourage behaviour for a particular time. Even if they don't want to support police...at least plant a seed of change within the communities."" ""If we do not take steps to intervene in communities in a meaningful way, we will continue to have this rhetoric."""

""Since mid-2023 we've been having some success with the gang legislation as we have been prosecuting gang members. Those matters are currently before the court. ""But I want to assure you that...we are focused on building evidentially sound cases that can meet the requirement for...robust scrutiny in the judicial system. ""We have been using every available avenue legally, so in the recent past we initiated prosecution based on the music that is being created in our local space as we recognise that the music is being used to influence and maybe even propagate the culture and associated activities.""

National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds has assured that the TTPS, in collaboration with the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force, has developed a multi-pronged approach to address the issue. Responding to a question in the House of Representatives on Friday, Hinds said the “most serious criminal offence” is engaging the attention of law enforcement. “This model allows for several covert and overt initiatives, which are aimed at investigating, suppressing and ultimately, eradicating this kind of offence,” he explained. “Additionally, this offence is considered in the schedule of offences under the Anti-Gang Act of 2021. As a result, the Gang Intelligence Units throughout the TTPS, are mandated to investigate all reports of these activities, even in instances where reports are not made, but intelligence suggests the existence of this offence, the police are mandated to pursue them. The TTPS is very aware of and understands the trauma experienced by victims in such matters, and, as such, the TTPS continues to encourage such members of the public to report all such encounters, confident that the criminals will be pursued to the end and justice in the end will be served,” Hinds continued. Questioned further on the success the authorities have had using this approach thus far, the Minister said there have been arrests and the suspects have been brought before the courts. “The police are pulsating with energy, constantly fighting them and will continue to do so,” he said. Asked about a timeframe for getting extortion against businessowners under control, Hinds said, “it’s a work in progress.”"

US officials seize over 300 firearms bound for Caribbean,2024,2,29,10,29,"An operation headed by the US Department of Homeland Security resulted in the seizure of 318 firearms, 314 magazines, and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition bound for CARICOM member states. Speaking at a media briefing on Wednesday following his return from the 46th CARICOM Heads of Government Conference, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said over half a million shipments were inspected during the exercise, calledOperation Hammerhead, which was led by US Homeland Security in 2023. The exercise took place over the course of three weeks in September 2023 in an effort to crack down on the illicit firearms trade between the US and CARICOM member states. He said as of data received in January 2024, during the operation, 600,000 packages destined for CARICOM were assessed and given increased scrutiny. Of that number, 4,600 were deemed to require enhanced inspection, and following these inspections, 318 firearms, 314 magazines and 19,270 rounds of ammunition were found bound for the Caribbean. “One can only envisage what that would have added to the horror that we’re already experiencing. As a result of that exercise…we initiated and supported, 25 international firearms trafficking cases and indictments and arrests are anticipated for several persons in the United States. “There is a positive outcome to be had by working alongside the United States at the source end of the supply of the guns and ammunition. That is not what we picked up here…[it was detected] at that other end that was destined for us.” He said enhanced training in collaboration with The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS) and other entities is also being undertaken for national security personnel in dealing with these issues. “We’re being told by IMPACS that the threat being posed by obsolete and unsecured weapons is a threat.” He said other CARICOM states are also trying to reduce the threat of unsecured and obsolete weapons within the country; the initiative is being funded by the UK government. The US governmenthas launched several initiativesto address firearms trafficking, including at the legislative level, with the signing into law of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to dramatically increase criminal penalties for straw purchasers and US-sourced firearms trafficking."

It is concerning and cannot continue unabated.” He said the Council is scheduling a meeting with the executive team of Port of Spain and environs, and called on National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds and Police Commissioner Erla Christopher to also engage with them in dialogue. “We firmly believe that it is only through united action that we can address the root causes of this epidemic. “Our children’s safety must be the cornerstone of our community’s foundation, and we are committed to advocating for measures that will protect our future generations. “The Council is adamant that these violent acts against our children should not be viewed as separate incidents but as part of a larger, more complex problem that requires collective attention and action. “We must come together as a nation to address these issues head-on, with the welfare of our children as our guiding principle.” The Council said one of the measures they are advocating for is stricter penalties for the possession of illegal firearms. “The time for action is now. We cannot allow the lives of our children to be threatened by senseless violence. “We invite all stakeholders, including parents, educators, community leaders and law enforcement to join us in this crucial mission.”"

Police said a quantity of the party drug was seized in Arima on Sunday night during a police operation led by officers of the Northern Division Task Force (Area North) led by Sgt Vitalis and Cpl Romany. Around 7pm the officers received intelligence which led them to an area along the Churchill Roosevelt Highway, where they seized a bag containing the drugs.

Around 6:20 pm yesterday, Smith was reportedly liming with a 22-year-old friend in the front yard of a house, when a white Nissan AD wagon pulled up alongside them. Two masked men exited the vehicle and opened fire without warning, injuring both Smith and his 22-year-old friend. The suspects returned to the waiting vehicle and drove off. In the aftermath, Smith was found bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds about his body including his chest and head. The 22-year-old appeared to have been shot in his right leg. Residents of the area who heard the loud explosions notified the police and emergency services, who responded and conveyed both men to the Arima District Hospital. However, Smith died while undergoing treatment. The 22-year-old, police said, remained warded in a serious but stable condition up to 9 am today. Officers of the Homicide Bureau and the Northern Division, under the supervision of Snr Sup Smith, responded. Crime scene experts recovered 23 spent 9mm shells, and seven spent 7.62mm shells at the scene of the shooting. However, of concern to investigators, one of the spent shells was reportedly found to have the markings ‘TTAG’ – this marking is typically associated with the Trinidad and Tobago Air Guard. Police noted that recently, several spent shells with markings from national security apparatus, including the police service (TTPS) the Regiment (TTR), and even the Coast Guard (TTCG) have been found on various crime scenes - including woundings and homicides. The seized shells are expected to undergo ballistic testing at Camp Cumuto to determine if they can be linked to other incidents of firearm-related offences in the district. Police currently have no motive for the shooting. Commissioner of Prisons Deopersad Ramoutar confirmed he has been made aware of the incident and has offered condolences on the passing of Smith."
Family Law Association: Refer 'serious' domestic violence cases to DPP,2024,1,11,16,6,"The Trinidad and Tobago Family Law Association (TTFLA) believes that those accused of domestic violence should be investigated to determine if they have any firearm in their possession and, if so, surrendered as a precondition for bail application. This, as the TTFLA said a stronger message needs to be sent to perpetrators of domestic violence. The Association’s comments come as 43-year-old Calida Schamber and her 66-year-old mother Carmelita DeLeon were killed by her ex, 48-year-old Tesson Bradshaw, a soldier from Mandalay Gardens, Arima on January 2. In a statement, the Association further recommended that any defendant who is a member of the protective services should have their superior officer present at the hearing and the Court request that the accused is prohibited from access to firearms at their workplace. The Association also suggested that all Justices of the Peace who are permitted to grant bail be afforded special training to deal with people accused under the Domestic Violence Act under the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General. The organisation said it would be prepared to assist in such training. The TTFLA noted that the law currently allows for risk assessments to be undertaken by the police. “It is the considered opinion of the TTFLA that any risk assessment of the former domestic partner of the victim in the recently published double murder would have shown that he was likely to breach any Protection Order made against him,” the Association said. Additionally, the Association questioned the effectiveness of the National Domestic Violence Register in accordance with Section 21 of the Domestic Violence Act. “Has this Register been updated and access provided to all police officers so that they may inform the judicial officers at the hearing?” the TTFLA asked. And, in certain circumstances, the Association believes matters of serious domestic violence should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether other serious criminal offences have been committed. These offences, including attempted murder/manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and the like, should be prosecuted by the State. The TTFLA said: “In so doing the State would send a message to men and women who consider perpetrating domestic violence in keeping with the Preamble to the Domestic Violence Act and "" to reflect the community's repugnance to domestic violence in whatever form it may take and further influence the community's attitude and support social change in respect of this social ill"". In expressing condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones to domestic violence, the organisation expressed the hope that the State would provide the necessary counselling services for the affected families to begin the healing process."

UNC will restore law and order in T&T - Opposition Leader,2024,1,1,6,45,"Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar says the United National Congress (UNC) will restore law and order in Trinidad and Tobago. In her New Year's Message, Mrs. Persad-Bissessar addressed the ever-growing crime menace in Trinidad and Tobago and lamented the present government's handling of the situation. The UNC Leader said the government is hiding from engaging with the Opposition on anti-crime talks and has given the National Security portfolio to an ""abominably inept Minister."" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar also presented the UNC's plans and policy alternatives for addressing the crime challenges including introducing the ""Stand Your Ground"" legislation and improving access to legal firearms. ""I declare today that it is the mission of the United National Congress to do what this current government is either unwilling or unable to do - restore law, order, and prosperity to our great nation. A safe and prosperous Trinidad and Tobago must be the State's foundation for its citizens,"" Mrs Persad-Bissessar stated. ""Given that this government’s negligence has plunged our nation into the abyss, we must now unite to fight the wave of terror sweeping our nation regardless of what side of the political divide we as citizens may have stood in the past,"" the Opposition Leader added.

""The record number of murders, home invasions, robberies, and missing persons, a declining economy, increased costs of living, impending property taxes, and the looming increase in electricity and water rates have undoubtedly cast a shadow over our collective well-being,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar stated.

Once-safe communities, such as St Augustine, St Joseph, Chaguanas, Trincity, and Tunapuna, are highlighted as danger zones internationally,"" she added. The Opposition Leader went on to attack the government's handling of crime in the country. ""There are no government assurances of ending illegal drug and gun imports and gang warfare by sealing off the porous borders, improving surveillance, and boosting detection rates. There are no efforts at improving the inefficient criminal justice system through radical and urgent reform,"" she stated. ""Additionally, the Prime Minister continues to hide from engaging the Opposition and all stakeholders in anticrime talks but prefers to continue with his public relations game in which every citizen loses. While the country is being battered with violent lawlessness, the crucial National Security portfolio remains in the hands of an abominably inept Minister,"" Mrs Persad-Bissessar added. The UNC Leader said that a safe and prosperous Trinidad and Tobago must be the State's foundation for its citizens, and went on to present her party's plans and policy alternatives to address the challenges. She stated that the UNC would pass the ""Stand Your Ground"" legislation to give citizens the right to use lethal force within their homes to protect themselves and their families. In addition, the UNC political leader proposed giving greater access to legal firearms, implementing judicial and prison reforms, retooling the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, and proposing the return of the Community Comfort Patrols. Mrs Persad-Bissessar also proposed the return of the GATE program, the elimination of the property tax and other ""nuisance taxes,"" and the elimination of ""unfair and excessively high fines."" The Opposition Leader said that the UNC's approach to crime extends beyond policing and legislative actions only. ""The comprehensive governance components in addressing crime must also encompass social welfare, healthcare, business development, employment opportunities, and education. These main sectors collectively influence the crime rate, and a holistic strategy with structured operational policies, guided and managed by competent personnel, is essential to achieve progress effectively,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar stated. The UNC political leader also proposed hosting anti-crime consultations in the new year to develop effective crime-fighting strategies. ""Given that this government’s negligence has plunged our nation into the abyss, we must now unite to fight the wave of terror sweeping our nation regardless of what side of the political divide we as citizens may have stood in the past,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar said."
