Maxi-taxi driver charged for not assisting WPC,2024,7,19,11,0,"A maxi-taxi driver has been charged with failing to assist a police officer without reasonable excuse. The driver appeared before a Master of the Court in Port of Spain yesterday morning, and the case was adjourned to August 9. The driver's name has been withheld due to conflicting information regarding his identity. He was granted bail, which was secured by his wife. The charges were brought by WPC Jacob. According to a police report, around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, WPC Jacob was patrolling near City Gate in Port of Spain. She and other officers approached Bay Four (the La Horquetta and Maloney bay), where they noticed a man acting suspiciously with a black pouch. The police attempted to search the man, who resisted and was taken to the platform. During the search, he allegedly twisted WPC Jacob's left hand. WPC Jacob then asked for help from the driver, who was nearby. He refused, raising his hands and walking away despite her repeated requests. The suspect continued to struggle with WPC Jacob until other officers, led by Sgt Virgil, arrived to assist in detaining him. The next day, WPC Jacob and a team of officers returned to City Gate and arrested the driver. The arrest was captured by persons at the Bay and uploaded to social media sites. It has led to a public outcry over the actions of the police. He reportedly told his workers that he did not want to be seen aiding the police in such a public manner due to the seriousness of crime in this country, and he did not want to be a target of any retaliatory attacks. It was said that the police were not always present at City Gate, nor were they able to be everywhere - as it was pointed out that there had been at least 15 homicides reported this past weekend. This, persons have argued over the last few days, ought to constitute as reasonable cause, and it was argued that the charge should not have been levied against anyone in a similar situation.. However, the charge was facilitated by a law which exists within this country - Section 60 of the Police Service Act Chapter 15:01. The section notes : ""If a person is called upon to assist a police officer who is, while in the execution of his duty, assaulted or resisted or in danger of being assaulted or resisted, and such person refuses or neglects to assist accordingly without reasonable cause, he is liable on summary conviction to a fine of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and to imprisonment for one year.""

Trinibad artistes charged with drug trafficking,2024,7,10,10,16,"Days after he appeared before the courts on allegations of being a suspected gang member, Trinibad artiste Mescach Emmanuel AKA 'Plumpy Boss' was back before the courts. Emmanuel appeared on Monday charged with possession of cocaine for trafficking. He was jointly charged along with Keston Adams and Joseph ""Medz Boss"" Olliviere. All three men pleaded not guilty. The matter is expected to resume today as the Prosecution asked for time to secure background tracings on the accused men to make a determination on their arguments for bail. The trio were held on Saturday when police searched a car along the Solomon Hochoy Highway, near Gasparillo. In the car the officers allegedly found 18 grammes of cocaine in a plastic bag - leading to the arrests of all of the vehicle's occupants. Emmanuel was previously charged on July 1 with being a gang member, professing to be a gang member, and professing to be a gang member in order to promote a gang. The charges were laid contrary to Section 5(1)(d)(iii) of the Anti-Gang Act 4 of 2021 as amended. In that matter, he was arrested on June 29 after officers from the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) - Gang Investigations Team monitored several audio-visual music videos published on social media. The music videos allegedly featured the accused professing to be a member of a gang. He was granted $350,000 bail, which he was able to secure. This case is expected to be recalled on July 26.

Man killed while cycling in Santa Cruz,2024,7,10,9,26,"One man is dead while two others are nursing gunshot wounds following a shooting in Santa Cruz yesterday afternoon. The deceased has been identified as Benjamin Emmanuel of Sampson Trace off Sam Boucaud Road. According to police reports, around 4:20 pm on Tuesday afternoon, Emmanuel was seen riding a bicycle in a southerly direction along Tappin Street, when a black vehicle, registration number, make, and model unknown, stopped alongside him. The occupants of the vehicle lowered their windows and several loud explosions were heard. Emmanuel was hit several times about the body and fell to the roadway. Two other persons who police were told were simply standing in a close proximity were also hit in this incident. They are a 35-year-old man from Tappin Street, and a 71-year-old man from Jigga Hill in Santa Cruz. The 34-year-old was shot to the right thigh and left buttocks. The 71-year-old man was shot to his lower left leg. The vehicle then drove away. Persons in the area who witnessed the incident raised an alarm and notified the police and emergency health services. However, by the time of their arrival, Emmanuel had succumbed to his wounds. The two injured men were taken to the Port of Spain General Hospital where they were treated. Their conditions are said to be stable, as the injuries, while serious, are not life threatening. A team of officers under the supervision of Snr Sup Edwards responded to the report. The area was cordoned off and crime scene investigators recovered 15 spent shells comprising of 5.56 mm as well as 9 mm ammunition - leading investigators to believe that there were at least two shooters in the vehicle. While police do not have an official motive for the shooting, it was said that Emmanuel was known to them for drug related offences and as such it is suspected that his killing could be drug related. However, the incident has further left officers of the police service concerned as it was another example of innocent persons being injured due to the types of firearms - believed to be automatic weapons as well as semi automatic weapons - which are being utilized by criminal elements currently in this country. PC Ramdhanee is said to be continuing enquiries.

Cops find $4.5M worth of cocaine in hair products; suspect held,2024,7,10,7,24,"Police said they've made a ""major breakthrough"" with the seizure of around $4.5 million worth of cocaine hidden in hair products and the detention of a suspect in connection with the find. In an update the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) said officers executed an intelligence-led operation on Tuesday, resulting in the seizure of over $4.5 million worth of cocaine and the arrest of a key suspect. ""The operation stems from credible intelligence developed by the TTPS in 2023, which uncovered the operations of a sophisticated drug trafficking network based in South Trinidad. This network allegedly imported illegal narcotics from South America, concealed them within legitimate cargo, and exported them to various international destinations using local courier services. Following multiple arrests and significant seizures over the past year, the TTPS intelligence unit recently received information about an impending narcotics shipment. ""Acting on this intelligence, officers identified a vehicle linked to the drug trafficking network. On Tuesday, July 9, 2024, during a surveillance operation, the vehicle was spotted travelling along roads in the North Eastern Division. With operational support from the Northern Division Police, the officers intercepted the vehicle as it travelled eastward along the Churchill Roosevelt Highway near the Grand Bazaar shopping centre. ""Upon searching the vehicle, officers discovered several containers of hair cream, which, upon field testing, revealed the presence of cocaine."" The TTPS said officers seized a total of 3.25 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $4,530,240. The TTPS said the driver, a man from Point Fortin, was arrested and taken to the San Raphael Police Station for further inquiries. Commissioner of Police, Erla Harewood-Christopher, said intelligence gathering is critical in disrupting criminal activities. “Intelligence gathering is the cornerstone of effective policing. It allows us to anticipate and disrupt criminal activities before they can inflict harm on our communities.

Trinidad cops to be stationed in Tobago to tackle rising murder toll,2024,7,9,13,17,"Trinidad-based officers will be stationed in Tobago on a short-term basis to help tackle the island’s rising murder rate, following a recentquadruplemurder that occurred earlier this week. Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday in Tobago following a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC), Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said the support is needed as ""familiarity breeds contempt"". “Tobago’s policing…is such that we have to probably do things a little bit differently. I was advised that approximately 90 per cent of the officers who are policing Tobago are Tobagonians in Tobago, and that might be a good things…but there are certain outflows from that which cause me and others to believe that the policing effort is not as sharp as it should be, largely because of the general maxim that familiarity breeds contempt, and we have decided in a meeting this morning that the Tobago policing effort can benefit form a greater effort of intermingling of the services. “…our Tobago officers, particularly the young ones, should benefit from exposure and training with officers who are not domiciled in Tobago that will improve their development, their skill levels, that will allow them to function more effectively.” Dr Rowley said the new arrangement will include a short-term rotation of Trinidad officers and that assistance will be given to secure short-term accomodation to help facilitate this. Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley held a meeting of the National Security Council in Tobago on July 9, 2024, hours after quadruple and triple murders were recorded in Black Rock, Tobago. Also attending the meeting were National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds, THA Chief Secretary Farley Augustine, Police Commissioner Erla Christopher-Harewood, THA Minority Councillor Petal Daniel-Benoit, and other senior TTPS officers. Police Commissioner Erla Harewood-Christopher said further details would be released shortly after discussions with other senior officers. Dr Rowley urged Tobagonians to cooperate with the new arrangement. “It’s not that Trinidad has perfected its own policing…we believe that Tobago, with its peculiar smaller population…should really not be overrun by criminal conduct."" He also said some Tobagonians are aware of criminal activity and must share what they know with the police. “There are a few tens of thousands of people in Tobago, many of you know exactly who is doing what and you have not been sharing that information sufficiently with the police.” When asked regarding the island's gang activity and whether the suspects belonged to Trinidad or Tobago-based gangs, the TTPS said that there are criminal elements from both islands. Dr Rowley added that Tobago's E999 system will be updated so that callers can be directed to the TTPS' Tobago offices to enhance response times, as well as creating stronger connections with Tobago communities to enhance the crime response. Additionally, he said plans are being made to strengthen Tobago's police headquarters and proposals were made for a pre-fab structure in Bacolet to establish an administrative policing centre there. Chief Secretary of the Tobago House of the Assembly, Farley Augustine, who also attended the meeting, said as an island seeking to grow its tourism revenue, Tobago must address this issue. ""I want you to see today's meeting as being proactive...we're not waiting until the situation worsens to then respond. Certainly with...one of its main productive sectors outside of the government sector in tourism, we certainly don't want this getting beyond where it is now."" On Tuesday, armed gunmen opened fire on four men who were playing cards in Black Rock, resulting in the island'sfirst quadruple murderin history, pushing the island's murder toll to 16, matching its highest record from 2009.

Gangs moving on Tobago? Police warn of 'sleeper cells',2024,7,9,10,48,"Just hours after a Joint Select Committee on National Security on Monday, on Tuesday morning, Tobago was rocked by itsfirst quadruple killing – the murders took place just hours after a triple murder took place in Black Rock, Tobago on Monday. Speaking at aJSC on National Securityto address the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) Violent Crime Reduction Plan, Legal Officer at the TTPS Special Investigations Unit, Zaheer Ali said it appears that gangs have been trying to seize territory in Tobago, contributing to recent bloodshed. “There are a few major criminal gangs that have sleeper cells in various parts of Trinidad and Tobago. It’s significant in terms of what we’re seeing in Tobago, where gangs that have established themselves…are continuing to seek other opportunities, whether it be in the context of opportunities for lucrative drug blocks or easy avenues for trafficking, dangerous drugs [etc]…that migration to Tobago is looking to take charge of territories that might be lucrative to the gangs.” Ali said the TTPS is committed to utilising anti-gang legislation to the full extent in order to crack down on these gang-related activities and to ensure convictions. “I want to assure…that we are exploring all legislation to ensure that we have control over gang and gang-related activities…” Police Commissioner Harewood-Christopher said a meeting was planned with Tobago officials to address the island’s spiralling murder rate. “I want to assure the Tobago public that our focus is on Tobago as much as it is on Trinidad. Over the last two months I would have deployed additional manpower to Tobago because we would have seen the rise of the crime. So we have officers from the GEB and the IATF now functioning in Tobago and that is a permanent initiative. “As of this morning, another team of officers from the Inter-Agency Task Force has left to provide training for frontline officers in Tobago…to ensure that they are capable and competent in doing basic road checks, teaching them to build their confidence to confront “perceived” offenders. “So we have been focusing on Tobago and we will continue to focus…as a matter of fact we will be meeting with the administration in Tobago.” Harewood-Christopher said a 15 per cent reduction in murders had been set as the target for 2024, however the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service achieved one per cent of its target, with 299 murders as of July 8 compared to 301 for the same period in 2023. In terms of targets, from January to July 8, 2024, Christopher said the TTPS achieved its target of a 15 per cent reduction in violent crime, with 2,726 reports in 2023 compared to 2,324 reports in 2024. In terms of serious crimes, the TTPS said it surpassed its 15 per cent target, with a 17 per cent reduction of 5,803 reports in 2024 compared to 7,026 reports in 2023. However, the TTPS did not meet its target of a 20 per cent detection rate, achieving a 10 per cent detection rate for 2024 to date. Regarding the implementation of the violent Crime Reduction Plan, she said the schedule had been hampered by human resource changes but would be completed by August. “We were a bit challenged with the implementation schedule and what happened over the last year we had changes with human resources…that would have set us back a bit…we are in the process of redesigning the schedule.” Harewood-Christopher said the new schedule would be completed by August 2024.

Tobago records first quadruple murder,2024,7,9,8,49,"With the death of Jumoke Duncan, Tobago has officially recorded its first quadruple murder. Duncan was fatally shot on Monday morning in an incident which claimed the lives of Anslem Douglas 56, of Black Rock; Samuel McKain, 56, of Mt Pleasant; and Gregory Hamlet, 53, of Golden Lane. Police were told that around 12:30am on Monday a group of men were playing cards along the main road in Black Rock when they were confronted by two armed men. The suspects opened fire on the group without warning. They then fled the scene. Douglas, Hamlet, and McKain died at the scene. Duncan died later in the day while receiving treatment at the Scarborough General Hospital. Several spent shells were found at the scene of the shooting. This incident pushes the murder toll up to 16 - which is the same number as the highest number of murders ever recorded on the island. That record was set in 2009. The number of murders recorded in 2023 was 15 - which also means that these killings have pushed the islands murder toll above last year's figure. Post mortems are expected to be performed this week. Officers of the Tobago Division, under the supervision of ACP Collis Hazel and Snr Sup Rodhill Kirk, are amping up patrols and operations on the island in a bid to curb the violence. Police have been given intelligence that the latest killings are retaliatory - in response to recent shootings on the island. As such, they have classed the killings as gang-related. Snr Sup Kirk told reporter that the organisation had also received intelligence which has led to several persons being questioned. However, police are once again imploring citizens to work with law enforcement and citizens are being urged, if they see something or know something, to reach out to the police. Hazel also noted that 'all was not lost'. ""I assure you all is not lost. We are still policing the island. The police were out and about when the incident happened. It was just unfortunate these persons found themselves in such an unwanted situation,"" Hazel said. The senior officer also encouraged Tobago's residents to band together against criminal activities. He noted that the island is now facing an influx of high-powered guns, which were used in Monday's unfortunate incident. Officers of the Inter Agency Task Force and the Guard and Emergency Branch were deployed in late May to help with crime fighting initiatives and have seen successes, with the arrests of criminal elements, the dismantling of one gang and the seizure of firearms. But, the officers said that due to the porous borders of the island, high-powered weapons were finding their way into the hands of criminal elements. And as such, it is important that citizens work with the police.",death jumoke duncan tobago officially recorded first quadruple murder duncan fatally shot monday morning incident claimed life anslem douglas black rock samuel mckain mt pleasant gregory hamlet golden lane police told around monday group men playing card along main road black rock confronted two armed men suspect opened fire group without warning fled scene douglas hamlet mckain died scene duncan died later day receiving treatment scarborough general hospital several spent shell found scene shooting incident push murder toll number highest number murder ever recorded island record set number murder recorded also mean killing pushed island murder toll last year figure post mortems expected performed week officer tobago division supervision acp collis hazel snr sup rodhill kirk amping patrol operation island bid curb violence police given intelligence latest killing retaliatory response recent shooting island classed killing gangrelated snr sup kirk told reporter organisation also received intelligence led several person questioned however police imploring citizen work law enforcement citizen urged see something know something reach police hazel also noted lost assure lost still policing island police incident happened unfortunate person found unwanted situation hazel said senior officer also encouraged tobago resident band together criminal activity noted island facing influx highpowered gun used monday unfortunate incident officer inter agency task force guard emergency branch deployed late may help crime fighting initiative seen success arrest criminal element dismantling one gang seizure firearm officer said due porous border island highpowered weapon finding way hand criminal element important citizen work police,fatal shooting,Tobago,11.25,-60.667

"DJ, entertainer from Beetham Gardens held with cocaine",2024,7,7,18,46,"Police exercises across several parts of the country yesterday led to the arrest of 12 people, the seizure of three firearms, a quantity of ammunition and narcotics and the recovery of four vehicles. In the Central Division, during an exercise at Mora Street, Homeland Gardens, Cunupia, officers received information which led them to stop a Suzuki Vitara with four male occupants. Checks revealed that the vehicle had incorrect registration plates. A further check resulted in the discovery of one AR-15, with a magazine and 10 rounds of 5.56 ammunition, a revolver with six rounds of .38 special ammunition, a Chrome .380 Pistol, with magazine, three Black masks, one Holster and three mobile phones. The suspects, ages 23, 24, 32 and 37 all of Port of Spain, are expected to be charged for various offences. Officers of the Central Division Task Force, during exercises yesterday also seized a Glock 19 Pistol at Cedar Hill Road, Claxton Bay.

"PM Rowley: 70,000 rounds of ammo bought by SSA, unaccounted for",2024,7,3,15,15,"Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said based on the results ofan auditinto the operations of the Strategic Services Agency (SSA), it was discovered that the agency had initiated the procurement of military weapons before the matter was officially approved by Cabinet, with around 70,000 rounds of ammunition still unaccounted for. Speaking on the matter in Parliament on Wednesday, Dr Rowley said the matter is being investigated by the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS). Dr Rowley said the audit discovered that a former SSA director “initiated the procurement of high-grade, military, bolt-action rifles, complete with the most modern silencers and other accessories. The SSA was engaged in training specially selected, questionably hired personnel in the skill and use of such weapons”. “All this, Madam Speaker, before the amendment to the Act in November 2023, which allowed the SSA to have and keep firearms. “It was only on November 1, 2023, upon the request from the then-director of the SSA for the agency to bear arms in certain restricted circumstances…that Cabinet approved and Parliament authorised SSA staffers to keep and carry concealed pistols whether on duty or not. “This matter is gaining the attention of the police as we speak.” “One aspect of the audit has so far revealed that the use and/or whereabouts of 70,000 rounds of ammunition purchased by the SSA remains unrecorded and unaccounted for.” He said this remains the subject of a continuing audit and police investigation while corrective action in the respect of the management of arms and ammunition has been taken. He said some of the actions taken include a review of the Firearms and Ammunition policy published in April 2022 as well as the procurement and use of vehicles, firearms and ammunition inventory checks at all SSA locations. He said prior to the authorisation in 2023, the National Security Council was not aware that the SSA possessed such a large quantity of arms and ammunition. “There was never a budget in the SSA to purchase military grade weapons nor was the NSC ever informed of any such activities or that such capabilities were being developed. “This did not prevent the SSA from making part-payment for military-grade weapons with suppression capabilities.” He said the audit also found evidence of a connection to a Christian military cult. ""Several family members and associates of particular persons and of a particular church were found to have been surreptitiously employed in the agency. Such persons belonged to a cult which was arming itself while preaching a doctrine for trained military and paramilitary personnel with a religious calling to be the most suitable persons to replace the country's leadership."" He said also referred to a 'self-described spy' who appeared at the Cumuto camp and turned over a number of weapons that had initially come from the TTPS but had been transferred to the SSA.

Not to harbour, not to facilitate, and not to lionize these criminal elements who are hell bent on destroying our communities and by extension, our country... They thrive on the power that we give them. The simple action of sharing their misgivings on social media gives them a voice and in so doing, exposure, that they use to recruit and poison our youth,"" Marshall said.

Charges laid against three in SSA investigation ,2024,5,21,13,1,"Charges were laid last night against three former members of the Strategic Services Agency (SSA). Pastor Ian Brown, a self-proclaimed spy for the SSA, was charged along with Sgt Sherwin Waldron and Susan Portell-Griffith. Griffith was said to be a former security supervisor, while Waldron was a tactical operations officer. They are all expected to appear before a Master of the Court on charges related to misbehaviour in public office. Major Roger Best, who formally headed the SSA, has not been charged. However, police noted that investigators were still ongoing in the matter, and they were expected to seek legal advice as it pertained to what other charges could be laid in the future. Investigators sought advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC yesterday afternoon on what charges if any could be laid against the three men. After some time, Gaspard gave instructions to charge the trio. Best was fired on Saturday, three days after he and the three others were detained and questioned in relation to state-issued firearms. He was released that same day. On Sunday, Prime Minister Dr Keity Rowley said that the government was “blindsided” by the allegations made concerning the SSA. At the time he was speaking during a media conference at the Piarco International Airport upon his return from India. Best was sent on administrative leave on March 2, and according to the Office of the Prime Minister, several investigations had begun within the agency following reports of “misconduct.” “We had been blindsided by this agency, but fortunately the government was able to be informed at an early stage and we approached it with vigour and commitment. There is an ongoing, very serious investigation that is taking place and as I said before, some of what has been unearthed in this investigation has been quite troublesome,” he said. According to the Prime Minister, there are also “impressions of criminal conduct” that are being investigated by the authorities. “The Cabinet did not fall short to act and we expect that we will rectify it and return the agency to its purpose,” Rowley said. He later explained that retired Brigadier General Anthony Phillips-Spencer will continue to head the SSA in the interm. ""For the time being that will be satisfactory as we try to get to the bottom of what was going on in the SSA...I can tell you a lot of what we have discovered is quite troubling, but it being a matter of national security we handled it responsibly and action has been taken and will be taken along the way. Eventually, there may be changes in the leadership but Brigadier Spencer is as good an officer we could have had to deal with these circumstances,” the Prime Minister said.",charge laid last night three former member strategic service agency ssa pastor ian brown selfproclaimed spy ssa charged along sgt sherwin waldron susan portellgriffith griffith said former security supervisor waldron tactical operation officer expected appear master court charge related misbehaviour public office major roger best formally headed ssa charged however police noted investigator still ongoing matter expected seek legal advice pertained charge could laid future investigator sought advice director public prosecution roger gaspard sc yesterday afternoon charge could laid three men time gaspard gave instruction charge trio best fired saturday three day three others detained questioned relation stateissued firearm released day sunday prime minister dr keity rowley said government blindsided allegation made concerning ssa time speaking medium conference piarco international airport upon return india best sent administrative leave march according office prime minister several investigation begun within agency following report misconduct blindsided agency fortunately government able informed early stage approached vigour commitment ongoing serious investigation taking place said unearthed investigation quite troublesome said according prime minister also impression criminal conduct investigated authority cabinet fall short act expect rectify return agency purpose rowley said later explained retired brigadier general anthony phillipsspencer continue head ssa interm time satisfactory try get bottom going ssai tell lot discovered quite troubling matter national security handled responsibly action taken taken along way eventually may change leadership brigadier spencer good officer could deal circumstance prime minister said,non-shooting,N/A,,

Cops seek help from public on Cocorite quadruple killing,2024,5,10,12,30,"Even as police continue to question two brothers, aged 29 and 33, in connection with the killings of four people in Cocorite on Saturday night, they are continuing to look for other individuals who can be linked with the incident. However, investigators have hit a wall, and are calling on citizens to work with the police and to present any information they may have on the incident, even anonymously, in the bid of detaining all who are responsible for the mass shooting. In the interim, police said that by next week both brothers, who are from Waterhole Road in Cocorite, are expected to appear before the courts charged with ammunition possession. Investigators are expected to consult with officials from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC over the weekend to determine if the two suspects can face other charges. The 29-year-old has been described as the 'prime suspect' in Saturday's shooting by law enforcement agencies. He was held on Sunday night by officers of the Western Division Task Force as well as the Western Division Gang and Intelligence Unit at the Piarco International Airport. It is believed he was attempting to flee the jurisdiction. The officers, led by Snr Sup Henry, Sup Williams, ASP Lynch, and Sgt Jeanville, received intelligence that the suspect, who is from Waterhole Road in Cocorite, was planning on fleeing the country following the mass shooting incident.

While he had nothing illegal on his person, the officers detained the individual and executed a search warrant at his home in his presence, where they found 13rounds of assorted 9mm ammunition as well as 5.56mm ammunition. As a result of the find, two other men who were at the home at the time of the operation were also arrested. Police said that they are working on further intelligence to locate all people responsible with Saturday night's incident which claimed the lives of 22-year-old Shaquille Ottley, of Phase 1, Powder Magazine, Cocorite Extension; 57-year-old Antonio Jack of Phase 1, Powder Magazine, Cocorite; 31-year-old Sadiki Ottley of Phase 1, Powder Magazine, Cocorite Extension; and 36-year-old Jonathan Osmond of Phase 1, Powder Magazine, Cocorite. According to police reports, around 11 pm on Saturday, a group of people were liming on the eastern side of Building F in Phase 1, Powder Magazine in Cocorite when a dark-coloured vehicle, make, model, and registration number unknown, drove onto the compound.

Cops close to finishing Hannah Mathura case,2024,5,3,12,23,"Trigger Warning: This article contains information of a sensitive nature. Details include that of possible child mortality and abuse. Readers are encouraged to use their discretion. Police are still compiling evidence to bring to the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard, SC, for instructions on how to proceed against an elderly couple in connection with the death of Hannah Mathura. Mathura's skeletal remains were discovered in the back yard of her Valsayn home in March. In April, DNA results confirmed that the remains were indeed that of the 18-year-old girl, who was last seen alive in 2017. Investigators toldLoop Newsthat they are crafting a meticulous case in this matter to ensure that all loose ends were tied up before approaching the DPP's office for instructions on how to proceed against the couple. Throughout the process, police said, they have been receiving legal advice. Officials are in the final stages of compiling a file on this matter, with the hope that by as early as next week, they will be able to close the investigation. On March 12, officers received information which took them to the home and led them to excavate a 15 by 20 foot area in the backyard where they found skeletal remains, believed to be Hannah. A post-mortem performed the following day at the Forensic Science Center in St James revealed that there were holes in the skull, which appeared to be consistent with gunshot injuries. However, DNA testing was ordered to confirm if the body was indeed that Hannah's, as there were certain inconsistencies with the findings. Samples were taken from both parents and submitted for testing. The couple, a 66-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman, was arrested that day. Their seven children aided police with inquiries and have given statements. On March 19, officials from the Homicide Bureau approached the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC.

Top Cop commends officers after cocaine bust in Chaguaramas,2024,4,26,12,55,"Commissioner of Police, Erla Christopher, commended the ""invaluable contribution"" of police intelligence units in the successful dismantling of a prominent international drug trafficking network, resulting in the apprehension of an international criminal. In a statement the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) said on April 5, 2024, the Spanish National Police, in collaboration with international agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the National Crime Agency (NCA), and law enforcement from the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Trinidad and Tobago, along with other regional and international law enforcement agencies successfully dismantled a prominent international drug trafficking network. This criminal organization, operating primarily in the Spanish Levante area, was intercepted while transporting a ton of cocaine via sailboat from Suriname to Valencia. The operation resulted in the seizure of 1,165 kilograms of cocaine hidden aboard a sailboat, with another ton of the narcotic substance intercepted. A total of 31 individuals associated with the organization were arrested, while assets totalling ten million euros were seized, including three boats valued at 4.2 million euros, 44 vehicles, 40 branded watches, 60 works of art, 54 mobile phones, and a virtual cryptocurrency wallet. Additionally, 44 properties were seized and 74 bank accounts were blocked. This operation, initiated in mid-2022, involved cooperation among many regional and international arms of law enforcement. The TTPS said the arrest of the international criminal was a significant breakthrough in the fight against transnational organized crime. The TTPS said it played a pivotal role in this operation by providing crucial intelligence on the crew and the said sailboat involved in the drug trafficking operation. The vessel implicated in the drug trafficking operation, arrived in Trinidad and Tobago in April 2023, with four crew members from Suriname. A TTPS intelligence unit diligently monitored the crew and the vessel while docked at Chaguaramas, contributing significantly to the success of the operation. ""Their meticulous work filled critical gaps in the intelligence framework and facilitated the development of key relationships with foreign partners based on the information provided."" CoP Christopher praised the dedication and professionalism of the officers involved: ""The outstanding work done by the officers in the apprehension of this notorious international criminal, demonstrates Trinidad and Tobago's unwavering commitment to global security. When we help dismantle the international criminal networks who ply their trade in our jurisdiction, we help ourselves, as we weaken the regional and local drug trafficking networks and reduce the impact of transnational organized crime.” She said the TTPS stands ready and able to play its role in supporting complex international criminal investigations.",commissioner police erla christopher commended invaluable contribution police intelligence unit successful dismantling prominent international drug trafficking network resulting apprehension international criminal statement trinidad tobago police service ttps said april spanish national police collaboration international agency drug enforcement administration dea national crime agency nca law enforcement netherlands france ireland trinidad tobago along regional international law enforcement agency successfully dismantled prominent international drug trafficking network criminal organization operating primarily spanish levante area intercepted transporting ton cocaine via sailboat suriname valencia operation resulted seizure kilogram cocaine hidden aboard sailboat another ton narcotic substance intercepted total individual associated organization arrested asset totalling ten million euro seized including three boat valued million euro vehicle branded watch work art mobile phone virtual cryptocurrency wallet additionally property seized bank account blocked operation initiated mid involved cooperation among many regional international arm law enforcement ttps said arrest international criminal significant breakthrough fight transnational organized crime ttps said played pivotal role operation providing crucial intelligence crew said sailboat involved drug trafficking operation vessel implicated drug trafficking operation arrived trinidad tobago april four crew member suriname ttps intelligence unit diligently monitored crew vessel docked chaguaramas contributing significantly success operation meticulous work filled critical gap intelligence framework facilitated development key relationship foreign partner based information provided cop christopher praised dedication professionalism officer involved outstanding work done officer apprehension notorious international criminal demonstrates trinidad tobago unwavering commitment global security help dismantle international criminal network ply trade jurisdiction help weaken regional local drug trafficking network reduce impact transnational organized crime said ttps stand ready able play role supporting complex international criminal investigation,non-shooting,N/A,,

Hinds: No TTPS negotiation with gangs,2024,4,16,17,46,"National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds has denied that the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service was directed to negotiate any peace deals between rival gangs. Responding to a question in the Senate on Tuesday, Hinds made it clear that the Government neither approved nor endorsed the alleged peace deals. He said: “The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has never engaged in any such dialogue. It follows therefore that the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has never informed the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that any such dialogue was undertaken by the TTPS. It would also follow that the Government could not endorse any such action. In addition, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has never suggested to the TTPS that this should be a considered approach as Government policy.” Hinds said the Police Service is tasked with developing strategies to respond to crime and other crime management issues within the country. To this end, he said strategic plans developed by the TTPS have sought to address these issues. He pointed to the 2023 Violent Crime Reduction Plan, designed to direct response to rising levels of illegal firearms, and troubling levels of gang activity. Particularly in the instance of treating with gangs, the Minister said the plan is aimed at dismantling criminal gangs, enhancing intelligence capabilities, increasing detection, and successfully prosecuting violent and prolific offenders. “The TTPS’ plan to dismantle criminal gangs, which is consistent with the government's policy, includes conducting extensive data mining on gangs in accordance with the law, selecting the most violent gang members from the gang database in each police division, and intensively targeting them.” “Applying precision-driven law enforcement and prevention strategies to those communities with persistent violent hotspots and controlling movements on our roadways and public spaces. Those are some the main features in the anti-gang thrust that this question quite properly focuses on,” Hinds added. But, the Minister’s extensive response did little to satisfy Opposition Senator Wade Mark, who posed the initial query. In a follow-up question, Mark asked why there was no statement from the Government distancing itself from the alleged peace deal mediation involving law enforcement. Hinds stressed that there was no need for such a position as Government’s policy on treating with criminal gangs is well established. “The Government’s policy is very clear, very highly publicised. The government didn’t have to extricate itself from any such action. The Police Service, led by the Commissioner of Police made it quite clear, satisfactory enough to the Government, on behalf of the people, made it clear that it did not endorse or support any such policy or action,” the Minister said. Questioned further by Mark on the existence of rogue elements within law enforcement, Hinds said this was “well-known”, “in the generality”. “There were rogue Cabinet members in this country, some of whom found themselves before the court, that is quite known to all of us, in the generality. On this specific matter, however, the Police Service’s policy, the Government’s policy, are well-known and published. And, if in the generality any member of the Police Service or any person goes contrary to those dictates; the guidance of those policies, then of course, if it amounts to criminal action, criminal action will be, has been in those circumstances taken.” Hinds said there was nothing more he could add on the specific issue.",national security minister fitzgerald hind denied trinidad tobago police service directed negotiate peace deal rival gang responding question senate tuesday hind made clear government neither approved endorsed alleged peace deal said trinidad tobago police service never engaged dialogue follows therefore trinidad tobago police service never informed government trinidad tobago dialogue undertaken ttps would also follow government could endorse action addition government trinidad tobago never suggested ttps considered approach government policy hind said police service tasked developing strategy respond crime crime management issue within country end said strategic plan developed ttps sought address issue pointed violent crime reduction plan designed direct response rising level illegal firearm troubling level gang activity particularly instance treating gang minister said plan aimed dismantling criminal gang enhancing intelligence capability increasing detection successfully prosecuting violent prolific offender ttps plan dismantle criminal gang consistent government policy includes conducting extensive data mining gang accordance law selecting violent gang member gang database police division intensively targeting applying precisiondriven law enforcement prevention strategy community persistent violent hotspot controlling movement roadway public space main feature antigang thrust question quite properly focus hind added minister extensive response little satisfy opposition senator wade mark posed initial query followup question mark asked statement government distancing alleged peace deal mediation involving law enforcement hind stressed need position government policy treating criminal gang well established government policy clear highly publicised government didnt extricate action police service led commissioner police made quite clear satisfactory enough government behalf people made clear endorse support policy action minister said questioned mark existence rogue element within law enforcement hind said wellknown generality rogue cabinet member country found court quite known u generality specific matter however police service policy government policy wellknown published generality member police service person go contrary dictate guidance policy course amount criminal action criminal action circumstance taken hind said nothing could add specific issue,non-shooting,N/A,,

However, relatives of the injured prisoners gave a different story, claiming that some of the inmates had been beaten by officers with batons and even brass knuckles. These allegations were even made in the High Court last week Wednesday and Thursday in review applications filed by the relatives of three prisoners who went 'missing' following the brawl. However, on Thursday, the court was told that after the incident, the three prisoners-Ayokie Charles, Ray Paul Julien and Kerry Valentino-were taken to hospital for treatment and then transferred to another facility. Charles and Valentino were transferred to the Golden Grove prison in Arouca, on the instructions of Prisons Commissioner Deopersad Ramoutar; while Julien was transferred to the Maximum Security Prison (MSP), also at Golden Grove. According to the inmates' attorney, officers were allegedly abusing an epileptic Muslim prisoner, which triggered the altercation. The prisoners were said to have been beaten severely, with one allegedly attacked with a brass knuckle, leaving them injured and covered in blood. Brown AKA 'Big Meesh’ had been remanded at the prison having been charged in 2020 with the murder of 22-year-old Joshua Fortune, which occurred in September 2019. Following Brown's death, via a press release, Ramoutar, in expressing condolences, noted that the cause of death has not been determined, but it would be revealed by an autopsy. He said a separate investigation by the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service would be initiated. Commissioner Ramoutar also stated that counseling services offered to officers will be extended to inmates and family of the deceased, if required. The Trinidad and Tobago Prison Service extended condolences to the family and friends of Brown, as well as the inmate population.

DNA results from skeletal remains in Valsayn to be revealed this week,2024,3,26,13,21,"Authorities said the results of a DNA test which will confirm the identity of skeletal remains found in Valsayn earlier this month are expected this week.

Who are the 'power few'? Police mount offensive against gang violence,2024,3,21,18,6,"The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) said it's continuing its strategic approach to violent crime and has been looking at several persons of interest connected with these violent crimes, termed the ""power few"". Speaking at a media briefing on Thursday at the TTPS headquarters in Port of Spain, Vena Butler, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Ag.), Criminal Division, said the police service has a defined Violence Reduction Plan. ""Team TTPS acknowledges that gangs and their activities are one of the policing challenges that we are currently facing and in that regard, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service Violence Reduction Plan is our roadmap. ""We understand the challenge with violent crimes to be built around gang, firearms and narcotics and our plan was established around five pillars....precision, intelligence, prevention, pro-activity and prosecutions."" A post shared by Loop TT (@loopnewstt) Butler said in terms of precision, the police service is focusing on the ""power few"". ""Focusing on what we term the ""power few"", those we have deemed to be the prolific offenders. This is ongoing on a daily basis...this helps us to target those persons that are responsible society for the violence and that fear of crime...we are firm in our resolve that the aim is to dismantle criminal gangs. ""We know that it's a major task bt we are committed to the work. While we recognise that dismantling is our ultimate goal, in the short term, we are working towards continually disrupting the activities that lead to this violence in our communities."" Police Comissioner Erla Christopher said for the year to date, the police service has already seized 117 weapons for the year 2024 as well as 1,430 rounds of ammunition. Over the past four years the TTPS seized 2,848 firearms and 84,373 rounds of assorted ammunition. Christopher said the war on illegal firearms and on violent crime continues. The update comes after aquintuple killing in Harpe Place, leading to a murder toll to date of 124 for the year, an increase compared to the same period in 2023 in which 107 murders were recorded. Rishi Singh, Senior Superintendent, Homicide Bureau of Investigations, said 23 people were charged for 26 murders - 11 of those were charged for murders committed this year. Of the murders committed this year, over half were gang and drug-related. He said the revised detection rate for 2023 increased to 16 per cent and he anticipates more improvements as 2024 progresses. Singh said an all-of-society approach is imperative in order to prevent vulnerable groups from falling prey to gang violence and crime. ""We have to understand...civic living is a responsibility of every citizen...despite the challenges that we face we're asking you to find the courage to come forward and support..."" ""Put into perspective that within the communities where gangs are prolific...within two kilometres you have multiple persons with motives and allegiance that occupy this small geographic space...in those spaces certain types of behaviour are nurtured. ""I'm saying all of this to put into perspective that the technology, the science and the people...are all in this space, and I want to encourage that we take steps internally, in those communities, that the leaders of those communities resolve that we can no longer encourage behaviour for a particular time. Even if they don't want to support police...at least plant a seed of change within the communities.""

""Since mid-2023 we've been having some success with the gang legislation as we have been prosecuting gang members. Those matters are currently before the court. ""But I want to assure you that...we are focused on building evidentially sound cases that can meet the requirement for...robust scrutiny in the judicial system. ""We have been using every available avenue legally, so in the recent past we initiated prosecution based on the music that is being created in our local space as we recognise that the music is being used to influence and maybe even propagate the culture and associated activities.""

No new evidence after latest search at Valsayn house,2024,3,21,12,53,"Despite searching a Valsayn home for several hours, police have yielded no new evidence in their investigations into the discovery of skeletal remains at the house. The officers arrived around 8:50 am on Wednesday and searched the premises until 2 pm. However, despite a meticulous search, with the aid of officials from the Canine Unit, the Aerial Support Unit, and the Crime Scene Unit of the Homicide Bureau, as well as an excavator, loaned by officials from the Tuanpuna/Piarco Regional Corporation was also sent, nothing new was found, police said. The search was conducted mere hours after police were instructed to release a 66-year-old man and a 62-year-old woman who were detained in connection with this ongoing investigation. These instructions were given on Tuesday evening after officials from the Homicide Bureau approached the Director of Public Prosecutions Roger Gaspard SC. Gaspard SC perused the files presented to him for just over two hours before instructing that the couple be released, as it was his view that further evidence was needed to form a prima facie case. Should this evidence be unearthed, the couple could be re-arrested. On March 12, officers of the North Central Division swooped down on the home after being informed of several illegal activities that allegedly took place at the premises. The male suspect, on seeing the police, fled the scene in a red Kia sedan. After securing the occupants of the home and taking them for medical treatment, police were informed that the body of an 18-year-old who was never reported missing was buried in the backyard. Officers excavated a 15 by 20 foot area in the backyard and found skeletal remains, believed to be that of Hannah Mathura, who was last seen alive in July 2017. A post-mortem performed the following day at the Forensic Science Center in St James revealed that there were holes in the skull, which appeared to be consistent with gunshot injuries. However, DNA testing was ordered to confirm if the body was indeed that of the 18-year-old, as there were certain inconsistencies with the findings. Samples were taken from both parents and submitted for testing, the results of which are not yet available. The couple was arrested on March 13. The male suspect was taken to the St Joseph Police Station, while the woman was taken to the Arouca Police Station.

TTPS clamping down on extortion of businesses,2024,3,15,14,58,"The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has noted an increase in and is treating with instances of criminal elements demanding money by menace from businessowners and operators, otherwise known as extortion.

Responding to a question in the House of Representatives on Friday, Hinds said the “most serious criminal offence” is engaging the attention of law enforcement. “This model allows for several covert and overt initiatives, which are aimed at investigating, suppressing and ultimately, eradicating this kind of offence,” he explained. “Additionally, this offence is considered in the schedule of offences under the Anti-Gang Act of 2021. As a result, the Gang Intelligence Units throughout the TTPS, are mandated to investigate all reports of these activities, even in instances where reports are not made, but intelligence suggests the existence of this offence, the police are mandated to pursue them. The TTPS is very aware of and understands the trauma experienced by victims in such matters, and, as such, the TTPS continues to encourage such members of the public to report all such encounters, confident that the criminals will be pursued to the end and justice in the end will be served,” Hinds continued. Questioned further on the success the authorities have had using this approach thus far, the Minister said there have been arrests and the suspects have been brought before the courts. “The police are pulsating with energy, constantly fighting them and will continue to do so,” he said. Asked about a timeframe for getting extortion against businessowners under control, Hinds said, “it’s a work in progress.”",trinidad tobago police service noted increase treating instance criminal element demanding money menace businessowners operator otherwise known extortion national security minister fitzgerald hind assured ttps collaboration trinidad tobago defence force developed multipronged approach address issue responding question house representative friday hind said serious criminal offence engaging attention law enforcement model allows several covert overt initiative aimed investigating suppressing ultimately eradicating kind offence explained additionally offence considered schedule offence antigang act result gang intelligence unit throughout ttps mandated investigate report activity even instance report made intelligence suggests existence offence police mandated pursue ttps aware understands trauma experienced victim matter ttps continues encourage member public report encounter confident criminal pursued end justice end served hind continued questioned success authority using approach thus far minister said arrest suspect brought court police pulsating energy constantly fighting continue said asked timeframe getting extortion businessowners control hind said work progress,non-shooting,N/A,,

A group of men reportedly approached the car and opened fire, before escaping on foot. The other occupants of the vehicle soon realised that Babb had been shot several times.

US officials seize over 300 firearms bound for Caribbean,2024,2,29,10,29,"An operation headed by the US Department of Homeland Security resulted in the seizure of 318 firearms, 314 magazines, and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition bound for CARICOM member states. Speaking at a media briefing on Wednesday following his return from the 46th CARICOM Heads of Government Conference, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley said over half a million shipments were inspected during the exercise, calledOperation Hammerhead, which was led by US Homeland Security in 2023. The exercise took place over the course of three weeks in September 2023 in an effort to crack down on the illicit firearms trade between the US and CARICOM member states. He said as of data received in January 2024, during the operation, 600,000 packages destined for CARICOM were assessed and given increased scrutiny. Of that number, 4,600 were deemed to require enhanced inspection, and following these inspections, 318 firearms, 314 magazines and 19,270 rounds of ammunition were found bound for the Caribbean. “One can only envisage what that would have added to the horror that we’re already experiencing. As a result of that exercise…we initiated and supported, 25 international firearms trafficking cases and indictments and arrests are anticipated for several persons in the United States. “There is a positive outcome to be had by working alongside the United States at the source end of the supply of the guns and ammunition. That is not what we picked up here…[it was detected] at that other end that was destined for us.” He said enhanced training in collaboration with The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS) and other entities is also being undertaken for national security personnel in dealing with these issues. “We’re being told by IMPACS that the threat being posed by obsolete and unsecured weapons is a threat.” He said other CARICOM states are also trying to reduce the threat of unsecured and obsolete weapons within the country; the initiative is being funded by the UK government. The US governmenthas launched several initiativesto address firearms trafficking, including at the legislative level, with the signing into law of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to dramatically increase criminal penalties for straw purchasers and US-sourced firearms trafficking.",operation headed u department homeland security resulted seizure firearm magazine almost round ammunition bound caricom member state speaking medium briefing wednesday following return th caricom head government conference prime minister dr keith rowley said half million shipment inspected exercise calledoperation hammerhead led u homeland security exercise took place course three week september effort crack illicit firearm trade u caricom member state said data received january operation package destined caricom assessed given increased scrutiny number deemed require enhanced inspection following inspection firearm magazine round ammunition found bound caribbean one envisage would added horror already experiencing result exercisewe initiated supported international firearm trafficking case indictment arrest anticipated several person united state positive outcome working alongside united state source end supply gun ammunition picked hereit detected end destined u said enhanced training collaboration caribbean community caricom implementation agency crime security impacs entity also undertaken national security personnel dealing issue told impacs threat posed obsolete unsecured weapon threat said caricom state also trying reduce threat unsecured obsolete weapon within country initiative funded uk government u governmenthas launched several initiativesto address firearm trafficking including legislative level signing law bipartisan safer community act dramatically increase criminal penalty straw purchaser ussourced firearm trafficking,non-shooting,N/A,,

According to reports, Ezekiel was standing alongside a red Kia Cerato in Laventille on Thursday when another vehicle pulled alongside andopened fire on the occupants of the Cerato. Stewart said these incidents are indicative of a societal crisis: “This devastating event, coupled with the recent indiscriminate shooting in front of a primary school in Port of Spain that exposed children to unimaginable trauma, underscores a deeply concerning trend: the diminishing value for the most innocent among us.” “These incidents are not isolated but indicative of a broader societal crisis that demands immediate and decisive action. “The frequency of such violence is alarming but particularly in Port of Spain and its environs. It is concerning and cannot continue unabated.” He said the Council is scheduling a meeting with the executive team of Port of Spain and environs, and called on National Security Minister Fitzgerald Hinds and Police Commissioner Erla Christopher to also engage with them in dialogue. “We firmly believe that it is only through united action that we can address the root causes of this epidemic. “Our children’s safety must be the cornerstone of our community’s foundation, and we are committed to advocating for measures that will protect our future generations. “The Council is adamant that these violent acts against our children should not be viewed as separate incidents but as part of a larger, more complex problem that requires collective attention and action. “We must come together as a nation to address these issues head-on, with the welfare of our children as our guiding principle.” The Council said one of the measures they are advocating for is stricter penalties for the possession of illegal firearms. “The time for action is now. We cannot allow the lives of our children to be threatened by senseless violence. “We invite all stakeholders, including parents, educators, community leaders and law enforcement to join us in this crucial mission.”",trinidad tobago national council parent teacher association inc calling urgent action following report death yearold ezekiel huggins apparent gangrelated shooting astatement council president walter stewart expressed profound sorrow extended deepest sympathy family affected incident according report ezekiel standing alongside red kia cerato laventille thursday another vehicle pulled alongside andopened fire occupant cerato stewart said incident indicative societal crisis devastating event coupled recent indiscriminate shooting front primary school port spain exposed child unimaginable trauma underscore deeply concerning trend diminishing value innocent among u incident isolated indicative broader societal crisis demand immediate decisive action frequency violence alarming particularly port spain environs concerning cannot continue unabated said council scheduling meeting executive team port spain environs called national security minister fitzgerald hind police commissioner erla christopher also engage dialogue firmly believe united action address root cause epidemic childrens safety must cornerstone community foundation committed advocating measure protect future generation council adamant violent act child viewed separate incident part larger complex problem requires collective attention action must come together nation address issue headon welfare child guiding principle council said one measure advocating stricter penalty possession illegal firearm time action cannot allow life child threatened senseless violence invite stakeholder including parent educator community leader law enforcement join u crucial mission,fatal shooting,Port spain,10.66,-61.508

In a statement the TTPS said: ""Following the public concern raised because of a video circulating on social media showing an adult female gyrating on a minor, the Cyber and Social Media Unit (CSMU) conducted investigations to ascertain the origin of a video. ""After a thorough investigation, the officers concluded that the video is an old video and is not a local video. The video originated in Antigua and Barbuda for Carnival celebrations in St. John’s in 2019. The number plate seen in the video on the white truck, though not fully visible, is that of an Antiguan number plate design. ""Although the video clip did not originate in this country, the TTPS is still urging the public to desist from sharing any video of this nature as doing so  may amount to child pornography contrary to Section 40 of the Children Act."" Original story: The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) is investigating a video circulating on social media showing an adult female gyrating on a minor. The TTPS said its investigation will determine if the offence of sexual touching of a child has been committed contrary to Section 19 of the Children Act. Section 19 of the Act states where a person touches a child and the touching is sexual, and the child is under 16 years of age, the person commits an offence. The Act further states that a person who commits this offence is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of TT$50,000 and imprisonment for 10 years, or on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for 20 years. Additionally, if the touching involves the placing of any body part or an object onto the child’s genitalia, that person is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life. The TTPS warned against sharing the video as doing so may amount to child pornography contrary to Section 40 of the Children Act. This section of the Act states that a person who knowingly publishes, distributes, transmits, or shows any child pornography or who obtains access, through information and communication technologies, to child pornography, or has in his possession or control any child pornography, or purchases, exchanges, or otherwise receives child pornography commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine of TT$30,000 and imprisonment for 10 years. A person who knowingly distributes child pornography to another person is also committing an offence under the Act and could be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment if convicted.

According to the victim's account provided to the police, the ordeal unfolded on February 2 when he arranged to meet an individual he had previously communicated with solely through social media channels.

Prison officer killed in Arima ,2024,1,12,10,15,"A prison officer was shot dead in Arima on Thursday evening. The deceased has been identified as 36-year-old Kendell Smith of Greenvale Park, Cunupia. He was a prison officer attached to the Maximum Security Prison in Arouca. Smith was fatally shot yesterday evening in Samaroo Village in Arima. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras. Around 6:20 pm yesterday, Smith was reportedly liming with a 22-year-old friend in the front yard of a house, when a white Nissan AD wagon pulled up alongside them. Two masked men exited the vehicle and opened fire without warning, injuring both Smith and his 22-year-old friend. The suspects returned to the waiting vehicle and drove off. In the aftermath, Smith was found bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds about his body including his chest and head. The 22-year-old appeared to have been shot in his right leg. Residents of the area who heard the loud explosions notified the police and emergency services, who responded and conveyed both men to the Arima District Hospital.

Family Law Association: Refer 'serious' domestic violence cases to DPP,2024,1,11,16,6,"The Trinidad and Tobago Family Law Association (TTFLA) believes that those accused of domestic violence should be investigated to determine if they have any firearm in their possession and, if so, surrendered as a precondition for bail application. This, as the TTFLA said a stronger message needs to be sent to perpetrators of domestic violence. The Association’s comments come as 43-year-old Calida Schamber and her 66-year-old mother Carmelita DeLeon were killed by her ex, 48-year-old Tesson Bradshaw, a soldier from Mandalay Gardens, Arima on January 2. In a statement, the Association further recommended that any defendant who is a member of the protective services should have their superior officer present at the hearing and the Court request that the accused is prohibited from access to firearms at their workplace. The Association also suggested that all Justices of the Peace who are permitted to grant bail be afforded special training to deal with people accused under the Domestic Violence Act under the auspices of the Office of the Attorney General. The organisation said it would be prepared to assist in such training. The TTFLA noted that the law currently allows for risk assessments to be undertaken by the police. “It is the considered opinion of the TTFLA that any risk assessment of the former domestic partner of the victim in the recently published double murder would have shown that he was likely to breach any Protection Order made against him,” the Association said. Additionally, the Association questioned the effectiveness of the National Domestic Violence Register in accordance with Section 21 of the Domestic Violence Act. “Has this Register been updated and access provided to all police officers so that they may inform the judicial officers at the hearing?” the TTFLA asked. And, in certain circumstances, the Association believes matters of serious domestic violence should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether other serious criminal offences have been committed. These offences, including attempted murder/manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and the like, should be prosecuted by the State. The TTFLA said: “In so doing the State would send a message to men and women who consider perpetrating domestic violence in keeping with the Preamble to the Domestic Violence Act and "" to reflect the community's repugnance to domestic violence in whatever form it may take and further influence the community's attitude and support social change in respect of this social ill"". In expressing condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones to domestic violence, the organisation expressed the hope that the State would provide the necessary counselling services for the affected families to begin the healing process.",trinidad tobago family law association ttfla belief accused domestic violence investigated determine firearm possession surrendered precondition bail application ttfla said stronger message need sent perpetrator domestic violence association comment come yearold calida schamber yearold mother carmelita deleon killed ex yearold tesson bradshaw soldier mandalay garden arima january statement association recommended defendant member protective service superior officer present hearing court request accused prohibited access firearm workplace association also suggested justice peace permitted grant bail afforded special training deal people accused domestic violence act auspex office attorney general organisation said would prepared assist training ttfla noted law currently allows risk assessment undertaken police considered opinion ttfla risk assessment former domestic partner victim recently published double murder would shown likely breach protection order made association said additionally association questioned effectiveness national domestic violence register accordance section domestic violence act register updated access provided police officer may inform judicial officer hearing ttfla asked certain circumstance association belief matter serious domestic violence referred director public prosecution determine whether serious criminal offence committed offence including attempted murdermanslaughter grievous bodily harm like prosecuted state ttfla said state would send message men woman consider perpetrating domestic violence keeping preamble domestic violence act reflect community repugnance domestic violence whatever form may take influence community attitude support social change respect social ill expressing condolence family lost loved one domestic violence organisation expressed hope state would provide necessary counselling service affected family begin healing process,fatal shooting,Arima,10.6333,-61.2833

This was confirmed by Snr Sup Mervyn Edwards, head of the North Eastern Division.

UNC will restore law and order in T&T - Opposition Leader,2024,1,1,6,45,"Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar says the United National Congress (UNC) will restore law and order in Trinidad and Tobago. In her New Year's Message, Mrs. Persad-Bissessar addressed the ever-growing crime menace in Trinidad and Tobago and lamented the present government's handling of the situation. The UNC Leader said the government is hiding from engaging with the Opposition on anti-crime talks and has given the National Security portfolio to an ""abominably inept Minister."" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar also presented the UNC's plans and policy alternatives for addressing the crime challenges including introducing the ""Stand Your Ground"" legislation and improving access to legal firearms. ""I declare today that it is the mission of the United National Congress to do what this current government is either unwilling or unable to do - restore law, order, and prosperity to our great nation. A safe and prosperous Trinidad and Tobago must be the State's foundation for its citizens,"" Mrs Persad-Bissessar stated. ""Given that this government’s negligence has plunged our nation into the abyss, we must now unite to fight the wave of terror sweeping our nation regardless of what side of the political divide we as citizens may have stood in the past,"" the Opposition Leader added. The Opposition Leader's New Year's Message, posted on her social media pages, wasted little time in painting a picture of desolation and hopelessness in Trinidad and Tobago and exploring the ramifications of the increase in lawlessness in society. ""The record number of murders, home invasions, robberies, and missing persons, a declining economy, increased costs of living, impending property taxes, and the looming increase in electricity and water rates have undoubtedly cast a shadow over our collective well-being,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar stated. ""The United States has expanded its dire travel warnings about Trinidad and Tobago, and other countries will likely follow soon. Once-safe communities, such as St Augustine, St Joseph, Chaguanas, Trincity, and Tunapuna, are highlighted as danger zones internationally,"" she added. The Opposition Leader went on to attack the government's handling of crime in the country. ""There are no government assurances of ending illegal drug and gun imports and gang warfare by sealing off the porous borders, improving surveillance, and boosting detection rates. There are no efforts at improving the inefficient criminal justice system through radical and urgent reform,"" she stated. ""Additionally, the Prime Minister continues to hide from engaging the Opposition and all stakeholders in anticrime talks but prefers to continue with his public relations game in which every citizen loses. While the country is being battered with violent lawlessness, the crucial National Security portfolio remains in the hands of an abominably inept Minister,"" Mrs Persad-Bissessar added. The UNC Leader said that a safe and prosperous Trinidad and Tobago must be the State's foundation for its citizens, and went on to present her party's plans and policy alternatives to address the challenges. She stated that the UNC would pass the ""Stand Your Ground"" legislation to give citizens the right to use lethal force within their homes to protect themselves and their families. In addition, the UNC political leader proposed giving greater access to legal firearms, implementing judicial and prison reforms, retooling the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, and proposing the return of the Community Comfort Patrols. Mrs Persad-Bissessar also proposed the return of the GATE program, the elimination of the property tax and other ""nuisance taxes,"" and the elimination of ""unfair and excessively high fines."" The Opposition Leader said that the UNC's approach to crime extends beyond policing and legislative actions only. ""The comprehensive governance components in addressing crime must also encompass social welfare, healthcare, business development, employment opportunities, and education. These main sectors collectively influence the crime rate, and a holistic strategy with structured operational policies, guided and managed by competent personnel, is essential to achieve progress effectively,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar stated. The UNC political leader also proposed hosting anti-crime consultations in the new year to develop effective crime-fighting strategies. ""Given that this government’s negligence has plunged our nation into the abyss, we must now unite to fight the wave of terror sweeping our nation regardless of what side of the political divide we as citizens may have stood in the past,"" Mrs. Persad-Bissessar said.",opposition leader kamla persadbissessar say united national congress unc restore law order trinidad tobago new year message mr persadbissessar addressed evergrowing crime menace trinidad tobago lamented present government handling situation unc leader said government hiding engaging opposition anticrime talk given national security portfolio abominably inept minister mr persadbissessar also presented uncs plan policy alternative addressing crime challenge including introducing stand ground legislation improving access legal firearm declare today mission united national congress current government either unwilling unable restore law order prosperity great nation safe prosperous trinidad tobago must state foundation citizen mr persadbissessar stated given government negligence plunged nation abyss must unite fight wave terror sweeping nation regardless side political divide citizen may stood past opposition leader added opposition leader new year message posted social medium page wasted little time painting picture desolation hopelessness trinidad tobago exploring ramification increase lawlessness society record number murder home invasion robbery missing person declining economy increased cost living impending property tax looming increase electricity water rate undoubtedly cast shadow collective wellbeing mr persadbissessar stated united state expanded dire travel warning trinidad tobago country likely follow soon oncesafe community st augustine st joseph chaguanas trincity tunapuna highlighted danger zone internationally added opposition leader went attack government handling crime country government assurance ending illegal drug gun import gang warfare sealing porous border improving surveillance boosting detection rate effort improving inefficient criminal justice system radical urgent reform stated additionally prime minister continues hide engaging opposition stakeholder anticrime talk prefers continue public relation game every citizen loses country battered violent lawlessness crucial national security portfolio remains hand abominably inept minister mr persadbissessar added unc leader said safe prosperous trinidad tobago must state foundation citizen went present party plan policy alternative address challenge stated unc would pas stand ground legislation give citizen right use lethal force within home protect family addition unc political leader proposed giving greater access legal firearm implementing judicial prison reform retooling trinidad tobago police service proposing return community comfort patrol mr persadbissessar also proposed return gate program elimination property tax nuisance tax elimination unfair excessively high fine opposition leader said uncs approach crime extends beyond policing legislative action comprehensive governance component addressing crime must also encompass social welfare healthcare business development employment opportunity education main sector collectively influence crime rate holistic strategy structured operational policy guided managed competent personnel essential achieve progress effectively mr persadbissessar stated unc political leader also proposed hosting anticrime consultation new year develop effective crimefighting strategy given government negligence plunged nation abyss must unite fight wave terror sweeping nation regardless side political divide citizen may stood past mr persadbissessar said,non-shooting,N/A,,
